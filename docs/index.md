**The alarm clock that adjusts itself according to your commute time**

## How It Works
*Explain how it does what it does*

## Intended users

* **People who have longer work commutes**

    > As someone who commutes 1 hour each way for work, I don't always know when there will be construction or closures that will add an extra half hour or more to my drive. Waking up earlier when my commute will be longer would help me from being late or missing my important meetings in the morning. <

* **People who live in areas with erratic weather**

    > During the winter months, there's no telling if a storm that happens in the middle of the night is going to be a light dusting or plug the streets up with 2 feet of snow. If it's going to take extra time to get to school in the morning, I need to know so I can wake up with enough time to have a good breakfast before my exams. <
